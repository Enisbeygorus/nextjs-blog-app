### Introduction

I am front end and MERN developer. I graduated from mathematics department and learned coding by myself. I want to share my experiences and roads I passed. I want to get straight to the point.

### Start Point

Don't forget there is no shortcut to learn a skill that is important. If you want to learn it and understand it deeply you need to practice a lot.
If you want to be front end developer tou need to learn 3 cornerstones:

1.  **HTML**
2.  **CSS**
3.  **JavaScript**

**HTML**: The HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be.

**CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document.

**JavaScript**: is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

If we can give an example about this you can think like this. Let's say:

> Red plane is flying

plane is the HTML part, the color red is the CSS part and the flying is the JavaScript part.

### First Task: Practice with HTML and CSS

Let's say you have 1 hours for 30 days total 30 hours. give 5 hours to HTML then 25 hours to CSS. After that you can start with JavaScript.

You need to learn basics about HTML. You can learn from watching tutorials or reading documents. I suggest as a beginner you can start with
watching tutorials then as your experiences build up you will start to read documents at some point.

Don't lost into tutorials there is no end. There are almost infinite content or tutorials you can't learn them all at once. After finishing HTML start with CSS.

**Now here is the First Task**. It doesn't matter if you are ready or not. Just build simple website.**I Repeat after 30 hours JUST BUILD A WEBSITE**. Select a simple page in the internet.
It may be a weather app page, e-commerce page or a blog page. It doesn't matter

You don't have to build entire website. Just build one page. You need to build components:

- Header
- Navigation Bar
- Content
- Responsive Content
- Footer
- Dashboard Image

Those are general components in page.

**What are you trying to learn?**

1. Get use to HTML and CSS syntax.
2. Learn to layout.
3. Learn to design.
4. How to center components.
5. Responsive design, how will it look on mobile phone or in monitor.

### Second Task: Learn JavaScript

After building couple of page now start with JavaScript. Now there are so many things to learn but don't be afraid.
Again just watch 1 or 2 tutorial but not too much. After learning the basics add simple features to your single page which you built with HTML and CSS.

Let's say you built a weather app where there is a number on the screen shows how many degrees the weather is. And some text about is it rainy, sunny or cloudy.
Now you want to change those texts or numbers with clicking a button.

Okey no matter which project you are in there are the sample steps that you can take as an action, for example:

1. Create a button element.
2. Creat a function which can change a text that you want.
3. Connect button element with function.

Even it is a simple or complicated task you need to divide main task into smaller tasks. After that you will see how easy to do make those smaller tasks.
Eventually you will completed your main task. Maybe you thought the task you were doing was hard but it was not as hard as you think.

### Third Task: Build Web Applications

Let's assume that you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Now it's time to start a middle project.
I can suggest that you can build a product catalogue. This could be a book, clothes or souvenirs.

Build an app where you can display your product. Imagine what companies want? Is it e-commerce website,
data about football players, social application or just a website telling about their services. Find out what the market wants and build it.

### Fourth Task: Result

If you build 2-3 web applications now things are getting interesting. You need to learn Framework. This could be React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or any other framework.

Check this [Road Map](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) to learn steps. It is a detailed road map.
This is where you are free now. Ask yourself what do you want? Which product that will make you happy to work on?
After deciding what you want just practice a lot.

I believe if you are practise a lot and never give up that you will eventually find a job or start a project where you can earn your life with it.

Hope you have a good day!
